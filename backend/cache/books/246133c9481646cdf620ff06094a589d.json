Before he awakens to find himself strapped to a gurney, surrounded by strangers in hazmat suits. Before a man Jason\u2019s never met smiles down at him and says, \u201cWelcome back, my friend.\u201d In this world he\u2019s woken up to, Jason\u2019s life is not the one he knows. His wife is not his wife. His son was never born. And Jason is not an ordinary college physics professor, but a celebrated genius who has achieved something remarkable. Something impossible. Is it this world or the other that\u2019s the dream? And even if the home he remembers is real, how can Jason possibly make it back to the family he loves? The answers lie in a journey more wondrous and horrifying than anything he could\u2019ve imagined\u2014one that will force him to confront the darkest parts of himself even as he battles a terrifying, seemingly unbeatable foe. Dark Matter is a brilliantly plotted tale that is at once sweeping and intimate, mind-bendingly strange and profoundly human\u2014a relentlessly surprising science-fiction thriller about choices, paths not taken, and how far we\u2019ll go to claim the lives we dream of.",
